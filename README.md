# Chemical_Engineering_Formulaes
In this repository I will be coding the formulas which are widely used in chemical engineering. The code in this file will be python based along with libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib etc.This repository will also have Python based chemical engineering calculators.


** FILE ** --- Ideal Gas Law Calculator.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- Calculates pressure, volume, number of moles, temperature using Ideal Gas Law.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python and Numpy installed. Enter three variables, leave one blank to calculate. 


** FILE ** --- Arrhenius Equation.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- This arrhenius equation solver can solve for k and T. If you have a target k then this solver will give you temperature required to reach the target k. This solver also plots the graph between temperature and rate constant.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python and Numpy installed. Enter the values of k or T for whichever case you want to solve or plot the graph.
