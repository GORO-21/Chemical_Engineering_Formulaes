# Chemical_Engineering_Formulaes
In this repository I will be coding the formulas which are widely used in chemical engineering. The code in this file will be python based along with libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib etc.This repository will also have Python based chemical engineering calculators.


** FILE ** --- Ideal Gas Law Calculator.ipynb
** DESCRIPTION** --- Calculates pressure, volume, number of moles, temperature using Ideal Gas Law.
** USAGE** --- Run in Jupyter notebook with Python and Numpy installed. Enter three variables, leave one blank to calculate.
